# README Generator

## Description

This project was created in order to ease the process of creating README files for projects by taking user input and automatically creating a markdown file that is already formatted to reflect quality README standards. Creating a README can be tedious, especially when you are excited to upload your project! This project gave me a lot of hands-on experience with utilizing inquirer in order to take user input and take the input data to work with.

## Credits

As always, I would like to thank the University of Arizona for giving me the knowledge and resources to learn and improve my coding abilities that contributed to the making of this project. 

## Features

This project allows for the creation of a preformatted README file. The only thing that is left is to allow for icons for badges and licenses which will be addressed in a future update.
